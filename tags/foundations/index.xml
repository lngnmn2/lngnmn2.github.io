      <description>DESCRIPTION: Oops, I did it again.
The hack The word &amp;ldquo;implies&amp;rdquo; and corresponding arrows are grossly overloaded and have more than one subtle but distinct meanings.
We will read and interpret the &amp;ldquo;arrows&amp;rdquo; (and the word &amp;ldquo;implies&amp;rdquo;) from different formalisms differently (as an implication in terms of necessity and sufficiency and as a single discrete step of causality).
We will put the universal notion of an environment (and the corresponding Î“ abstraction) from obscurity to the center.</description>

      <description>Stupid people would usually ask &amp;ldquo;why do we need all this theoretical bullshit and abstracted theories&amp;rdquo;?
The answer is, to have &amp;ldquo;the right understanding&amp;rdquo; and because of that to be able to do things &amp;ldquo;just right&amp;rdquo;.
&amp;ldquo;Just right&amp;rdquo; has many meanings and implications. Among other things it is that what has been &amp;ldquo;done right&amp;rdquo; (ideally &amp;ndash; a local optimum) does not require any further modifications.
It was indeed &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; (right). There is nothing more to remove (or alter).</description>
