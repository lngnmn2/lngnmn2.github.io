  <div class="post-content"><p>Have you ever thought <em>why</em> the <em>Set Theory</em> and <em>Predicate Logic</em> looks &ldquo;the
same&rdquo; when being visualized using Venn and Euler diagrams?</p>
<p>Are these <em>partitions</em> is the most fundamental abstract building block?</p>
<p>Most of the examples which are used to explain logic has been drawn from
&ldquo;natural categories&rdquo; of biological species - mammals, reptiles, men.</p>
<p>These are distinct partitions indeed, but how they came to be as they
are?</p>
<p>It is because somewhere in the past a literal &ldquo;fork&rdquo;, a mutation (or a
whole set of these) occurred (and the resulting population survived).</p>
<p>Schematically, it was a &ldquo;split&rdquo; event, denoted as \(&lt;\). Or a &ldquo;fork&rdquo;.</p>
<p><em>After</em> such kind of a &ldquo;split&rdquo; or a &ldquo;fork&rdquo; two distinct &ldquo;partitions&rdquo; have
been emerged - one which has a new distinct property, and the other
which does not.</p>
<p>At all levels, from DNA to whole species the same reasoning (or a
universal law) applies.</p>
<p>Notice that this process has a <em>direction</em>, and the notion of something
being <em>prior</em> to something else - an implicit ordering.</p>
<p>When we reduce everything to bunch of <em>dots and errors</em> (connected into
directed graphs) we would be able to see the Causality Itself at work.</p>
<p><em>This is why</em> we see all the dots and arrows in most fundamental
mathematical and logical formalisms.</p>
<p>So, &ldquo;logic works&rdquo; because (and only because) the Causality is out there,
it has its &ldquo;patterns&rdquo; and &ldquo;directionality&rdquo; (which one may mistake for
the abstract notion of Time).</p>
<p><em>Function composition</em> which is one of the most fundamental building
blocks of the <em>Lambda Calculus</em> (an implicit Environment is another one)
has been &ldquo;implemented as nesting&rdquo; to capture the notion of
directionality, is depicted as a <em>two joined arrows</em> - the fundamental
building block.</p>
<p>This is also signifies the fact than no &ldquo;fork&rdquo; occurred there.</p>
<p>All logic and mathematics could be unfolded back to these &ldquo;universal
patterns of Causality&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;steps&rdquo;, &ldquo;forks&rdquo; and &ldquo;joins&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Joins are the captured notion of &ldquo;necessary and sufficient&rdquo;, and
<em>currying</em> is a perfectly captured &ldquo;implementation&rdquo; &ndash; all slots has to be
filled in, and the intermediate state &ldquo;partially applied lambda&rdquo; is out
there.</p>
<p>Forks are all imaginary and hypothetical (it is always either one way or
another, as if multiple ways do not actually exist), but the results of
the events are real &ndash; the resulting &ldquo;partitions&rdquo; are distinct and observable.</p>
<p>This is an important notion. Every water molecule in a stream seem to
have an innumerable branching factor of an imaginary tree of potential
&ldquo;forks&rdquo;, yet, it goes it unique &ldquo;linear&rdquo; path without a single fork.</p>
<p>The principle is this: In order to be valid and sound logic, math,
machine learning algorithtms /has to be applied to actual patterns &ndash;
the properly captured and generalized data.</p>
<p>Just like addition is properly abstracted away from what is being added
(put together), <em>some</em> rules of logic are the properly captured
abstractions (by the same process within the Mind of an External
Observer).</p>
<p>It is not arbitrary that the notion of a Narural Number could be defined as a cardinality of a Set. This is the proper capture (the unary number system of scratches on a wall).</p>
<p>Sets capture the universal notions of partitioning (as results of
&ldquo;forks&rdquo;) which the Mind observes (and which are <em>out there prior to it</em>).</p>
<p>The whole <em>Tree of Life</em> has its structure due to what we call the
causality principle, which, in turn, is due to the laws of the Universe
(at this partocular locality).</p>
<p>Logic, maths and now the &ldquo;deep learning&rdquo; are &ldquo;results&rdquo; (proper
generalizations of some aspects) of these processes &ndash; Observing the
same &ldquo;mountain&rdquo; (Universe) from different distances and  points of view.</p>
<p>No fundamental &ldquo;correspondences&rdquo; or &ldquo;isomorphisms&rdquo; (at the level of dots
and arrows) are arbitrary.</p>
<p>The notions of the premises, of the shared environment, of the \[\Gamma\], of a
<em>global namespace</em> (and its nested frames) are capturing the fact of &ldquo;prior results&rdquo; - of stable intermediate results, necessary for new transitions (steps).</p>
<p>The point is to realize the <em>whys</em> these correspondences exist in the
first place, and then to use these fundamental building blocks &ldquo;just right&rdquo; in our programs.</p>
<p>All the fundamental notions has already been captured (but not
yet properly systematized).</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Dots and arrows</em> at the level of <em>closures</em></li>
<li><em>Sets of values</em> as simplest types (partitions)</li>
<li>Sets of <em>interfaces</em> (which are individual type-signatures)</li>
<li>Algebraic types (\(|\), $,$, \(\rightarrow\) )</li>
<li>Set Union at a type level,</li>
<li>Set Intersection at a type level</li>
<li>A Subset relation (as sub-classing)</li>
<li><em>concatenation</em> as a composition of Traits</li>
<li>Haskell type-classes as <em>required subset</em> at a interface level.</li>
<li>And the <em>Environments</em> in which everything happens</li>
</ul>
<p>The same building blocks are necessarily underlying any form of logic, and this is <em>why</em> Curry-Howard correspondence do exist.</p>
<p>Last but not least, it is all can be imagined a directed graph with retrospective &ldquo;forks&rdquo; and &ldquo;joins&rdquo;, which are not &ldquo;loops&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Iteration is a <em>spiral</em>, not a loop, just a recursive processes are.</p>
