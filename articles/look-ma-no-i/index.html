Carmack, sir).\nThere is what every “AI researcher” should know about Knowledge and Intelligence (yes, both capitalized).\nThere is so-called “reality” prior to any knowledge or intelligence. Any reasonable thinker has been arrived at the ultimate reality.\n“I am That” (“That Thou Art”) of Chandogya Upanishad is the “end of knowledge” and the “arrival” to the ultimate “truth”, with implies existence of “That” and one being just a sub-process (a wave) in It.\nThere is just nothing to talk about. Sectarian dogmatism is irrelevant against this ultimate result of an observing human mind.\nSo, about knowledge and intelligence?\nAll Knowledge is within That and in nowhere else. There is no abstract knowledge apart from That and all the true knowledge could (and should) be traced back to some or other aspect of That.\nAll the proper mathematics can be traced back to “ultimate reality”.\nOne more time: Knowledge is not within individuals (agents), Knowledge is within the shared environment (Universe). From this everything follows.\nWhen you (as an agent) observes some locality of our shared environment we literally “see” knowledge embedded in it everywhere.\nIt is just the “natural” habit of always asking “why it is so?”. Most of Knowledge is in the “whys” and little bit more in “hows”.\nNot just every human artifact has some reasoning of /why it has been done this particular way. Every natural phenomenon has its whys.\nWhys are special because they ought to show (describe) the causes - what caused this or that.\nWhat we call the Causality principle is behind everything That Is. Whys are less wrong explanations of it.\nNotice that there is always an ultimate true “graph” of causality which “produced” everything that is out there. There is nothing not connected within this imaginary directed graph of causes and effects.\nThe edge of this “front” is Everything That Is.\nSo, what about GAI?\nIt has to have the ability to “read” knowledge from What Is and put it back in some commonly agreed form of information, so all the other agents could read it too.\nIt is that simple. Intelligence is multi-agent phenomena and it is require multiple agents to observe the same “reality” (from different angles) and to share what they “know”.\nHuman knowledge is the shared knowledge implicit in all the human artifacts, just as causality is implicit in every aspect of Mother Nature.\nWe do not have to reinvent all the mathematics by every single person and we do not “learn” every time from a ground zero.\nEven animals have “knowledge” about its environment embedded in the structure of their brains and neural system.\nAll the living forms has been evolved to match the constraints of its environment in this parricular locality.\nLets state in one more time: Knowledge in not in the texts (most of texts are bullshit). Texts (and speech) are just encodings. Knowledge is in What Is and an Intelligence is the ability to observe and trace the causality and capture, extract and generalize knowledge.\nThere is no “I” in AI There is no knowledge or intelligence in current LLMs. Only information extracted from texts.\nThere is, literally, (and this is the best and the most adequate metaphor) no more knowledge or intelligence in an output of an LLM that in an audio output of a parrot (a bird) which mimics human speech.\nCurrent AI only mimics of (cosplays if you will) intelligence. It only looks intelligent (just like all the Chuds).\nIntelligence, again, is a habit and ability of tracing back (unwind) to What Is.\nIt is like non-stop verifying of the findings of a scientific method.\nThe famous Subjective vs Objective false dichotomy is only applicable to abstract bullshit. There is nothing “subjective” in any natural phenomena or a human artifact (everything has its ultimate whys and the exact “path” (a directed graphs) of how exactly it came to be in this particular way).\nEvery person has such a graph, a wast one, no different that any kitten or a dog (everyone has been conditioned by the events which happened to him).\nSo how do we even start to begin? Ultimately, the answer has been given some 2500 years ago - “To See Things As They Really Are”.\nBut understanding require knowledge of “facts” or the principles behind the Causality itself.\nSuch knowledge come from a multi-agent effort and is stored (literally) within the shared environment and within what we call a shared culture.\nThis means it has to be a multi-agent shared environment before we even begin.\nThen, of course, there has to be a shared (agreed upon or standardized) “encoding”, not for merely “information” (it is too low-level) but for “description of extracted knowledge” (just like it is with mathematical texts and notation).\nMay be the agents will “learn” its own “mathematical knowledge” (which is a set of properly captured generalizations stored in the shared culture).\nWho knows. But what we do know is that there is still no “I” in AI, not even close. Just very complex parroting at the level of texts and speech (which, again, are just encodings).\nTo see things as they really are is to be able to trace everything back to the actual causes (to What Is) using evolved methodologies (which are basically ability to see “natural” experiments and to perform well-controlled scientific ones).\nAgain, it is not in the texts, it is a process, like everything else in this Universe.\nSorry, Chuds, you are just emitting streams of verbalized bullshit in order to impress each other (and “validate” yourselves) according to your current cultural (sectarian) norms.\n",

<p>Lets put all the memes and bullshit aside, for a moment and talk serously about GAI (hello, mr. Carmack, sir).</p>
<p>There is what every &ldquo;AI researcher&rdquo; should know about Knowledge and
Intelligence (yes, both capitalized).</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> so-called &ldquo;reality&rdquo; <em>prior to</em> any knowledge or intelligence. Any
reasonable thinker has been arrived at the ultimate reality.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I am That&rdquo;</em> (&ldquo;That Thou Art&rdquo;) of Chandogya Upanishad is the &ldquo;end of
knowledge&rdquo; and the &ldquo;arrival&rdquo; to the ultimate &ldquo;truth&rdquo;, with implies
existence of &ldquo;That&rdquo; and one being just a sub-process (a wave) in It.</p>
<p>There is just nothing to talk about. Sectarian dogmatism is irrelevant
against this ultimate result of an observing human mind.</p>
<p>So, about knowledge and intelligence?</p>
<p><em>All Knowledge is within That</em> and in nowhere else. There is no abstract

<p>All the proper mathematics can be traced back to &ldquo;ultimate reality&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Human knowledge is the shared knowledge <em>implicit in all the human

<p>We do not have to reinvent all the mathematics by every single person

<p>Even animals have &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; about its environment <em>embedded</em> in the
structure of their brains and neural system.</p>
<p>All the living forms has been evolved to match the constraints of its
environment in this parricular locality.</p>
<p>Lets state in one more time: Knowledge in not in the texts (most of
texts are bullshit). Texts (and speech) are just <em>encodings</em>. Knowledge is
in <em>What Is</em> and an Intelligence is the ability to observe and trace the

<h2 id="there-is-no-i-in-ai">There is no &ldquo;I&rdquo; in AI<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#there-is-no-i-in-ai">#</a></h2>
<p>There is no knowledge or intelligence in current LLMs. Only information

<p>There is, literally, (and this is the best and the most adequate

<p>This means it has to be a multi-agent shared environment before we even

<p>Then, of course, there has to be a shared (agreed upon or standardized)
&ldquo;encoding&rdquo;, not for merely &ldquo;information&rdquo; (it is too low-level) but for
&ldquo;description of extracted knowledge&rdquo; (just like it is with mathematical
