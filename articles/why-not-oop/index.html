<p>Joe Armstrong said in his thesis that Java is not even suitable for

<p>It is good idea to try to <em>realize</em> why.</p>
<p>The fundamental flaw, which cannot be eliminated, comes from the fact
that the &ldquo;designers&rdquo; of Java lacked a required mathematical background.</p>
<p>The idea of mimicking the &ldquo;real world&rdquo; in which &ldquo;objects having its internal
state&rdquo; is exactly what is wrong.</p>
<p>Yes, &ldquo;object&rdquo; of real world do have internal state, but this fact does
not imply that the language for describing the world should have objects
with a state.</p>
<p>Mathematics does not have any state for a reason and it is a
meta-language for describing aspects of real world.</p>
<p>The way do deal with the state has been discovered long before OOP and
the principle is that we just <em>read and write</em> the data as it is.</p>
<p>Every classic language since Common Lisp and Standard ML have the REPL
functionality. The principle is that one can <em>print</em> a value of any type
and then <em>read</em> it back into a system.</p>
<p>This is the way to deal with a state. This, unsurprisingly, is similar
to what Erlang and telecom people called &ldquo;in-wire&rdquo; representation. We
just spell it out.</p>
<p>Having <em>&ldquo;an encapsulated mutable state within an object&rdquo;</em> which is the
main selling point of OOP is just wrong in a multi-threaded environment
with an unrestricted <em>write</em> access.</p>
<p>The right way is to have an immutable binding or an immutable reference
(as a proper, non-leaking abstraction &ndash; as an ADT).</p>
<p>Having at most one &ldquo;mutable reference&rdquo; is implicit in the classic FP
languages due to immutability of a binding - one has to explicitly pass
the value (of the type &ldquo;ref&rdquo;) along.</p>
<p>What Rust guarantees at the static type-system level (a major

mathematics instead of a processor (the principles on which it has been
built).</p>
<p>Everything else just follows. Again, it is not about the identity of an
