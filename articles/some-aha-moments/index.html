Now you are generate new training examples for them, not just for free, but some are paid for each token.

I spent, literally, a lifetime to learn to write the way I do (which is far from being satisfactory), and it just spit into your face what you hardly could write unless struggle for days, continuously refiling (which I, thank god, never do).\nSo, they trained on your slop as we speak (and call it major advancement in LLM training techniques), and when “personalized”, it quickly creates your own, personal Jesus, sorry, an echochamber, with all the known cognitive biases at work (when something else appear to be and being recognized and interpreted as something familiar).\nOne more time, the “magic” and appeal of LLMs is that they produce heavily cognitive biased appearances, which most people gladly and easily take “for real”.

The obsession of some famous MIT guys with fixed-points is not, of course, coincidental.\nThe trick, William Potter, is not minding that it hurts.\nBy the way, the proper way of prompting is to build a context very similar to what it has “already seen” and thus will easily extend, not some kind of “You are a helpful assistant” antrophomorphic bullshit, but once this very crap is constantly being feed back, it soon will become the only way to prompt.\n",
