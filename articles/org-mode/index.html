We can change the order (sort) according to some “priorities”. M-up and M-down “change the order”.\nThen, by adding the notion of “nesting” we could have a whole “horizontal dimension” in which every outline is nested within (is a part of) the previous one. M-left and M-right “change the nesting”.\nOrdering and nesting is a half of Universe, on which Life Itself has been evolved upon.\nTo have a stable structure is to maintain a particular order of elements.\nThe nested /environments and closures within (cells and enzymes) are possible because of the universal notions of ordering and nesting.\nUniversal notions There are the same “universal notions” underlying predicate logic, mathematical set-comprehension notation, sets-and-relations basis of SQL and the query languages like that one of Datomic.\nThese notions, by the way, are “natural and necessary implications” of the fact that Causality itself “can be seen as a bunch of directed graphs of single steps or transitions”. The Mind just observes and generalizes form the resulting “effects”.\nThis is not a coincidence that everything in CS can be reduced to such graphs (with no loops, but spirals of recursions) at various levels.\nSo, the universal notions which org-mode has been built upon are:\nAn ordering (having a particular structure) Nesting (of headlines and tags) Tagging, including type-tagging Sets and “groups” (based on tags) Predicates (on tags and groups) Selecting and queering (such that) There are “headlines”, which have several levels of outlining (nesting) usually up to 6.\nThe level of outlining of a headline is dynamic and semantically irrelevant, which means that it can be changed without altering the meaning.\nThe the outlines may capture the notion of a hierarchy and of general class-subclass, group-subgroup, set-subset relations.\nTODO Keywords When we define additional TODO keywords, such as NEXT or FIXME, we basically specialize them. Think of subsets without any inheritance.\nWhen we decorate headlines with such keywords they are semantically all TODOs (of different kinds). The meanings are up to the user.\nThey can be pre-defined globally using a variable, or defined in-place per-buffer (ad-hoc).\nTags In general, decorating with a tag is the same notion as attaching a label.\nWords (particular sequences of sounds) of a human language are such labels.\nHeadlines can be decorated (tagged) with symbolic tags (symbols).\nThis is closely related to the notion of type-tagging of individual values in memory, used in the early LISPs.\nWith tags we create the simplest ad-hoc non-systematic type-system.\nSome tags signify a major or minor category, some are just labels.\nPre-defined type-tags can be used as simplest types-as-sets markers.\nThe fundamental notion is that we just decorate (label) and all the “higher-level” grouping and filtering operations are orthogonal, and at are at the higher level of abstraction.\nThis corresponds to a generalized hierarchical structure, in which a type-system is at a higher level, “above” the terms.\nRelations Just as with Types or mathematical Sets, we could have an item decorated (annotated) more than one tag. This is a fundamental feature.\nSome tags, just like Sets, are semantically mutually exclusive, some are proper subsets of the other, some may have a non-empty intersection.\nThere is no way to systematically and consistently define such constraints.\nAgain, just as it is with the mathematical Set Theory, the meaning (semantics) is out of scope. Every meaning or “use” is up to the “user”.\nCategories There are simplest examples of tags\n:math: :programming: :trading: :emacs: :neovim: The first three are (stands for) whole “categories”, while the last two are just “type-tags”.\nOf course, they have the meaning only in how we interpret and use them.\nUnlike the traditional classic type-systems, we do not define a set of values by a set of all the possible operations (on individual values), which is what mathematicians do to define their own abstractions rigorously.\nSets, Groups, Monoids, Matrices, Tensors are examples of such “types”.\nOn capturing we tag ’em When we capture some new information, we not just create and choose a corresponding new headline, we also tag it with pre-defined (or even new, ad-hoc) tags.\nSelecting and grouping This is what it is all about within the org-mode. We group headlines (and other items) based on the tags.\norg-super-agenda provide the way to define such “groups” and there is even a whole “query language” (implemented as a library) in the org-ql package.\nThis does not mean we have to use them, but it is good to have them ready (and being maintained by other people).\norg-ql This is an implementation of an embedded DSL which corresponds to the mathematical set-comprehension notation, which rely on the such-that notion, based on predicate logic.\nNotice that Sets are untyped (and the elements are untagged), and defined in terms of a set of all possible operations.\nIt is also similar to a query language that Datomic offers.\nAgain, everything which has been properly captured can be “unfolded” back to the underlying aspects of What Is from which it has been generalized.\n",

<p>All your micromanagements are just means to keep you busy and to feel good (from continuous dopamine releases) about yourself for doing &ldquo;the right thing&rdquo;, and thus being <em>special</em> &ndash; &ldquo;not like everyone else&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="what-isn-t-bullshit">What isn&rsquo;t bullshit<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-isn-t-bullshit">#</a></h2>
<p>Headlines are just &ldquo;vertical&rdquo; lists &ndash; an ordered sequences. We can change the order (sort) according to some &ldquo;priorities&rdquo;. <code>M-up</code> and <code>M-down</code> &ldquo;change the order&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Then, by adding the notion of &ldquo;nesting&rdquo; we could have a whole &ldquo;horizontal dimension&rdquo; in which every <em>outline</em> is nested within (is a part of) the previous one. <code>M-left</code> and <code>M-right</code> &ldquo;change the nesting&rdquo;.</p>
<p><em>Ordering</em> and <em>nesting</em> is a half of Universe, on which <em>Life Itself</em> has been evolved upon.</p>
<p>To have a <em>stable structure</em> is to maintain a particular order of elements.</p>
<p>The <em>nested /environments</em> and <em>closures</em> within (cells and enzymes) are possible because of the universal notions of ordering and nesting.</p>
<h3 id="universal-notions">Universal notions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#universal-notions">#</a></h3>
<p>There are the same &ldquo;universal notions&rdquo; underlying predicate logic, mathematical set-comprehension notation, sets-and-relations basis of <code>SQL</code> and the query languages like that one of <code>Datomic</code>.</p>
<p>These notions, by the way, are &ldquo;natural and necessary implications&rdquo; of the fact that Causality itself &ldquo;can be seen as a bunch of directed graphs of single steps or transitions&rdquo;. The Mind just observes and generalizes form the resulting &ldquo;effects&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is not a coincidence that everything in CS can be reduced to such graphs (with no loops, but <em>spirals of recursions</em>) at various levels.</p>
<p>So, the universal notions which <code>org-mode</code> has been built upon are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <em>ordering</em> (having a particular structure)</li>
<li>Nesting (of headlines and tags)</li>
<li>Tagging, including <em>type-tagging</em></li>
<li>Sets and &ldquo;groups&rdquo; (based on tags)</li>
<li>Predicates (on tags and groups)</li>
<li>Selecting and queering (<em>such that</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are &ldquo;headlines&rdquo;, which have several levels of outlining (nesting) usually up to 6.</p>
<p>The level of outlining of a headline is <em>dynamic</em> and semantically irrelevant, which means that it can be changed without altering the meaning.</p>
<p>The the outlines may capture the notion of a <em>hierarchy</em> and of general <em>class-subclass</em>, <em>group-subgroup</em>, <em>set-subset</em> relations.</p>
<h3 id="keywords"><span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Keywords<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#keywords">#</a></h3>
<p>When we define additional TODO keywords, such as NEXT or FIXME, we basically <em>specialize</em> them. Think of <em>subsets</em> without any inheritance.</p>
<p>When we decorate <em>headlines</em> with such keywords they are semantically all TODOs (of different kinds). The meanings are up to the user.</p>
<p>They can be pre-defined globally using a variable, or defined in-place <em>per-buffer</em> (ad-hoc).</p>
<h3 id="tags">Tags<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tags">#</a></h3>
<p>In general, decorating with a <em>tag</em> is the same notion as attaching a <em>label</em>.</p>
<p>Words (particular sequences of sounds) of a human language are such labels.</p>
<p>Headlines can be decorated (tagged) with symbolic <em>tags</em> (symbols).</p>
<p>This is closely related to the notion of <em>type-tagging</em> of individual values in memory, used in the early LISPs.</p>
<p>With tags we create the simplest <em>ad-hoc</em> non-systematic type-system.</p>
<p>Some tags signify a major or <em>minor category</em>, some are just <em>labels</em>.</p>
<p>Pre-defined <em>type-tags</em> can be used as simplest types-as-sets markers.</p>
<p>The fundamental notion is that we just decorate (label) and all the &ldquo;higher-level&rdquo; grouping and filtering operations are orthogonal, and at are at the higher level of abstraction.</p>
<p>This corresponds to a generalized hierarchical structure, in which a type-system is at a higher level, &ldquo;above&rdquo; the terms.</p>
<h3 id="relations">Relations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#relations">#</a></h3>
<p>Just as with Types or mathematical Sets, we could have an item decorated (annotated) <em>more than one tag</em>. This is a fundamental feature.</p>

<h3 id="categories">Categories<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#categories">#</a></h3>
<p>There are simplest examples of tags</p>
<ul>
<li>:math:</li>
<li>:programming:</li>
<li>:trading:</li>
<li>:emacs:</li>
<li>:neovim:</li>
</ul>
<p>The first three are (stands for) whole &ldquo;categories&rdquo;, while the last two are just &ldquo;type-tags&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Of course, they have the meaning only in how we <em>interpret</em> and <em>use</em> them.</p>
<p>Unlike the traditional classic type-systems, we do not define a set of values by a set of all the possible operations (on individual values), which is what mathematicians do to define their own abstractions rigorously.</p>
<p><em>Sets, Groups, Monoids, Matrices, Tensors</em> are examples of such &ldquo;types&rdquo;.</p>

<p>When we capture some new information, we not just create and choose a corresponding new <em>headline</em>, we also <em>tag</em> it with pre-defined (or even new, <em>ad-hoc</em>) tags.</p>
<h3 id="selecting-and-grouping">Selecting and grouping<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#selecting-and-grouping">#</a></h3>
<p>This is what it is all about within the <code>org-mode</code>. We <em>group</em> headlines (and other items) based on the tags.</p>
<p><code>org-super-agenda</code> provide the way to define such &ldquo;groups&rdquo; and there is even a whole &ldquo;query language&rdquo; (implemented as a library) in the <code>org-ql</code> package.</p>
<p>This does not mean we have to use them, but it is good to have them ready (and being maintained by other people).</p>
<h3 id="org-ql">org-ql<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#org-ql">#</a></h3>
<p>This is an implementation of an <em>embedded DSL</em> which corresponds to the mathematical set-comprehension notation, which rely on the <em>such-that</em> notion, based on <em>predicate logic</em>.</p>
<p>Notice that Sets are untyped (and the elements are untagged), and defined in terms of a set of all possible operations.</p>
<p>It is also similar to a query language that <code>Datomic</code> offers.</p>
<p>Again, everything which has been <em>properly captured</em> can be &ldquo;unfolded&rdquo; back to the underlying aspects of <em>What Is</em> from which it has been generalized.</p>
