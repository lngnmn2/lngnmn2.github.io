  <div class="post-content"><p>Special concern for <em>precise</em> definitions, clarity and brevity
(omitting of what is clear from the context), high level of abstraction, and proper generality (just like Sets or Numbers).</p>
<p>Both <em>algebraic types</em> (&ldquo;products&rdquo; and &ldquo;sums&rdquo;), could be used &ldquo;like
tables&rdquo;, with new <em>columns</em> being added without affecting any code
that is already out there.</p>
<p>This implies a <em>by name</em> instead of position-based (offset) access.</p>
<p>This, in turn, is the fundamental, definitive property of structs over tuples.</p>
<p>There is a <em>named-tuple</em> abstraction, which deemphasize the structural properties and order of fields.</p>
<p>This is a universal principle (not using an offset for access and
using symbols and <em>implicit lookup tables or maps</em> instead).</p>
<p>It is possible to pretend (or restrict oneself) that both the actual
order of names (slots or &ldquo;columns&rdquo;) and of the &ldquo;rows&rdquo; is <em>immaterial</em>.</p>
<p><em>Proper, necessary restrictions</em> do wonders.</p>
<p>This is similar in properties to Sets (a most general unordered
collection) and to the strict <em>Relation Model</em> (of Codd).</p>
<p><em>Subclassing</em> in OO languages corresponds to the <em>set-subset relation</em> (\(\in\)).</p>
<p>Literally a set of interface is a proper subset of the set of interfaces
of the <em>superclass</em> (isomorphic to \(A \subset B\), if you will).</p>
<p>This was a major &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; back then and huge redundant <em>hierarchies</em>
has been built. Smart people back then said it is too rigid.</p>
<p>A trait is just a named set of interfaces <em>to be implemented</em> in order to
exhibit a particular <em>behavior</em> (quack like a duck and walk like duck).</p>
<p>Composition of <em>traits</em> corresponds to <em>concatenation</em> (without nesting).</p>
<p>Remember that a <em>function composition</em> is nesting (and braces) &ldquo;under the
hood&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is a subtle but crucial difference &ndash; with composition of traits
we perform <em>Duck-typing</em>, and <em>do not have to become a subclass (a proper subset)</em>.</p>
<p>This eliminates the idiocy of having to invent a subclass for having legs.</p>
<p>Arguably, the most fundamental recurring pattern in all programming is <em>nesting</em>, in particular, <em>wrapping</em>.</p>
<p>The famous &ldquo;<em>/everything can be solved with another level of indirection</em>&rdquo;
is about <em>wrapping</em>, which is nesting.</p>
<p>We wrap and nest <em>interfaces</em>, which is the main strategy for managing necessary complexity.</p>
<p>The idea is to wrap a complex, specialized interface in a higher-level, simpler, generalized, one.</p>
<p>The classic example is how a specific clout storage APIs can be wrapped as separate <em>plugins</em> (interexchangeable implementations).</p>
<p>This particular technique &ndash; to have specialized plugins &ndash; is a
high-level (system-level) modularity &ldquo;pattern&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At a <em>system level</em> having stable interfaces is the universal principle, which
works even at the level of molecular biology (and is actually the
main <em>underlying principle</em>).</p>
<p>There is a remarkable, outstanding example of the principles at work:</p>
<p><em>Tavis Ormandy</em> has been &ldquo;ported&rdquo; the old binary distribution of the
classic <em>Lotus 1-2.3</em> program to completely different platform from the
future (literally).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/taviso/123elf">https://github.com/taviso/123elf</a></p>
<p>He was able to do so because the actual CPU architecture is
backward-compatible and the ABI was standardized and still supported.</p>
<p>What he essentially did is wrapping, conceptually at the level of
interfaces, while working with the &ldquo;object files&rdquo; which represent
compiled functions (again, the ABI is similar and the actual binary
format was COFF i386).</p>
<p><em>Adding another level of indirection</em>, (around certain functions) indeed.</p>
<p>This achievement is so remarkable because it proves by example
(although no such prof are necessary) the validity of the universal
principles behind proper <em>non-leaking</em> ADTs of Barbara Liskov, and all the
ways back to Numbers (as defined by the Piano axioms) and the Set
Theory, and through them, all the way back to the Ultimate Reality,
which modern <em>Chuds</em> replace with arbitrary bullshit of the Mind.</p>
<p>Again, by properly generalizing the building blocks of <em>Life Itself</em>, we
(well, the old Princeton and MIT guys) came up with <em>closures (lambdas)</em>,
<em>bindings</em> (and necessary <em>environments</em>), <em>general recursion</em> (based on the
principle of <em>mathematical induction</em>) and <em>branching</em> (conditionals).</p>
<p>From these universal (properly generalized) building blocks <em>everything</em>
could be made.</p>
<p>All the conceptual build-up from a \(+1\) to a <em>Functor</em>, <em>Monoid</em> and <em>Matrices</em> is, of
course, not arbitrary or accidental.</p>
<p>Coming back to the mundane realms, the proper non-leaking abstraction
(as per Barbara Liskov&rsquo;s ADTs) allow not just multiple representations
and multiple implementations, but <em>mapping</em> implementations by <em>nesting</em>
functions, which, is an operational definition of a <em>function
composition</em>.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the <em>&ldquo;dots and arrows&rdquo;</em> diagrams from the Category
Theory (much hated because <em>Chuds</em> infested it like flies) would give one a
<em>proper insight</em> into what is actually going on at the procedure level with
all these object files, while abstracting away all the file formats and
other implementation details.</p>
<p>It is not just a <em>call-graph</em>, but all the arrows between Sets (types).</p>
