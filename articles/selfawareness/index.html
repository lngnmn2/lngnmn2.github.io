<p>Self-awareness and awareness is general <em>is not at a language level</em> (or <em>information</em> level).</p>
<p>Animals, obviously, have awareness, but not a &ldquo;language level awareness&rdquo; due to the fact that their brains lack <em>any</em> language areas.</p>
<p>The series of mutations and subsequent developments that lead to a human language is unique to humans.</p>
<p>All other animals are using just &ldquo;voices&rdquo; - pitch, volume, distinct cries, etc.</p>
<p>This is, actually, an important principle. Language-augmented awareness, after being taught theoretical and abstract concepts (from the shared language-based culture, which preserves the &ldquo;previous results&rdquo;) with it, which animals lack in principle, sees &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; everywhere.</p>
<p>Ones &ldquo;sees&rdquo; why animals of cold and harsh high-altitude Himalayan regions got a black fur (it is just favorable selection). One could see all the manifestations of causality in the Nature.</p>
<p>The social-level knowledge could also be seen clearly - how and why houses have been made (due to all the major environmental constraints, like scarcity of wood and abundance of stones), including all the &ldquo;economic decisions&rdquo; (or evolved traits). Economy comes from necessity (like energy preservation) and environmental constraints.</p>
<p>This, by the way, is what a knowledge is - one is habitally <em>tracing</em> everything one observes back to the underlying causality (whys and hows). This is <em>because</em> of this, this is because of that. The language-based shared culture (which stores the previous results or &ldquo;accumulated knowledge&rdquo;) is required to do so.</p>
<p>So, there are <em>four</em> different kinds of awareness:</p>
<ul>
<li>just of an observer without language-based concepts and abstract thoughts (animal-like).</li>
<li>self-awareness without any kind of a concept of Me or Myself (requires language-based abstract thinking)</li>
<li>language-augmented awareness with uses learned knowledge</li>
<li>language-based awareness of ones own sequential thinking <em>in words of a human language</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>GPT has <em>none</em> of these.</p>
<p>The principle is that <em>any form of awareness is at a higher level and prior to a language</em>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, at the brain level, <em>awareness</em> is just observing (paying attention) to ongoing processes within.</p>
<p>Selective attention is another topic, but it is basically &ldquo;hardware interrupts&rdquo; or just sensations (of pain or hunger).</p>
<p>So, no. any form of &ldquo;awareness&rdquo;, leave alone &ldquo;self-awareness&rdquo; based <em>only on information</em> (written human language) is bullshit.</p>
<p>It is, of course, possible to come up with an algorithm which <em>mimics and parrots</em> it to some extent (as in computer games) but it will be an illusion.</p>
<p><em>Mimicing and parroting</em> is precisely what all the LLMs do to - they produce information which seems (and only seems) &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo;, while we all know that it is just particular algorithmic tricks (probabilistic selection and perturbation).</p>
<p>Have I told you that the concept of &ldquo;probabilistic mind&rdquo; is an abstract bullshit, and that the mind reflects its environment (in which it has been evolved).</p>
<p>The issue of &ldquo;poisoning&rdquo; (or eroding) brain&rsquo;s inner representations (and even the whole shared culture) with abstract bullshit (non-biological sexes and what not) is the one that the LLM Chuds do not even begin to understand.</p>
<p>So, no. <em>Your LLM will never be aware</em>. (just like <em>you will never be a woman</em>). Wishful abstract thinking is not enough.</p>
