<p>The real take away from the whole manuscript (at least for me) was that writing <em><strong>tests</strong></em> is what really change everything, in particular, they are, indeed, allow quick, <em>confident</em> and &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; refactoring and thus really &ldquo;facilitate change&rdquo; and, yes, actually speed up the development process.</p>
<p>As a direct consequence the discipline which lately would be popularized as Test-Driven Development or TTD naturally emerge.</p>
<p>The key point is that it <em>forces</em> one to focus on public (abstract) interfaces and their specifications, and this, quire independently from Kent Beck, are just direct manifestations of the universal principles (of programming, regardless the  paradigm) formulated and popularized by Barbara Liskov and Michael Jackson back in the 70s.</p>
