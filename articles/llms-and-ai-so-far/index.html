<p>They all are still just [estimated] probabilities of the next token, given the &ldquo;context&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This implies no &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; or &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; [of any kind] whatsoever. Nothing can be taken as &ldquo;true&rdquo; or even &ldquo;correct&rdquo; or &ldquo;accurate&rdquo;.</p>
<p>All the talks about &ldquo;knowledge in the weights&rdquo; or &ldquo;knowledge encoded within the network&rdquo; is just bullshit.</p>
<p>This is a gigantic, hard to comprehend, unprecedented,  bubble. Just as in the Tulip Mania, people throw money at it, hoping to make more money, without any understanding of what is going on or whether it is possible to actually make money with a &ldquo;<em>glorified autocomplete</em>&rdquo;, which is always subtly wrong [and often very wrong].</p>
<p>There are <em>apparent</em> gains in &ldquo;productivity&rdquo; (the <em>sheer speed</em> at which the <em>low-effort crap</em> can be produced and pushed out, to become other people&rsquo;s problem), but no real gains in &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The process as a whole is just systematic &ldquo;enshittification&rdquo; of knowledge itself, and almost vertical race to the bottom, where a low-effort pretentious verbiage is the lowest common denominator.</p>
