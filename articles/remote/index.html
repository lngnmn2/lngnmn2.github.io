  "articleBody": "The dream Imagine, living in this or that beautiful and peaceful Buddhist country, in a picturesque hilly area, above 2000m, like Darjeeling and most of hill stations of India. There are beautiful mountain areas in Thailand, Sri-Lanka, even in Myanmar.\nIdeally, one has to move with the seasons, just like migration birds, from one nice place to another, and to have an endless summer.\nIt is absolutely real when one have just a Linux laptop, GNU Emacs, a couple of SIM cards and a GSM tower nearby. This is all you really need. And an ATM, of course.\nNowadays having a private Github repo is enough for anything serious, and the open-source tooling for software development is way better than proprietary commercial crap.\nOne could even set up a Trac wiki and an old-school mailing list on one’s own domain and have all the benefits of asynchronous communications and of writing everything down (which clarifies and frees the Mind). At least this kind of setup was good-enough to develop GHC - a highly sophisticated, state-of-the-art compiler suite (for Haskell).\nNotice, that most of highly productive teams behind major open-source projects never had a single “meeting”, leave alone a “standup”, and never meet in person – this is not required.\nan old-school classic approach Back in the 80s and 90s, which, arguably, was the golden age of programming if we look at evolution of the Classic languages (Lisp and the ML family), we did not have any “online” real-time constant-presence crap (except IRC, which was fun).\nAnother crucial factor was that in the 70s and early 80s to get an access to a computer, leave alone the internet, one has to have a proper education, usually math or CS degree, or to attend a technical University in the US, which had it all.\nAll the means of communication we had back then were , in principle, text-based, off-line, /asynchronous, like email and mailing lists and later Usenet.\nThe very first web-forums also have been done right, which the emphasis on a structured text and searchable archives (which is all you need). The most important feature of any hosted email service is that it keep all your messages in a searchable “database”. This was the “killer feature of the early Gmail”.\nIn short, we used the ancient “paradigm”, which goes back to the ancient “spiritual practices”, based on solitude, withdrawal from society, observation after taking a step back, and focused introspection.\nIn modern terms that would be, stay alone, read a lot, think a lot, write a little. This is what all the best writers of the modern age (Jung, Mann, Hesse, Sartre, Hemingway, etc.) have practiced and done.\nThe importance of solitude or at least withdrawal from the society is well-understood in serious organizations, which protect their principal actors from socially constructed bullshit by a small army of secretaries, assistants, lieutenants and what not.\nThe emphasis is not on that we need secretaries (though programs as automated assistants are crucial) but on the fact that emotionally charged social bullshit is a waste and even danger. It is definitely distraction and unnecessary “context switches”, which ruins whole days (ruins focus, concentration, cause “restarts” which never reach the same level, etc).\nLast but not least, the scientific communities still “run” on “paper-based” workflows - the very same “write everything down” universal approach.\nIn short, a form of written asynchronous communication is the most optimal way to perform distracting and mostly unnecessary (redundant) interactions with other people.\nAsynchronous Asynchronous here means that I read (work) at a proper time of the day, when I am well-primed and in the right mood, and I write at an appropriate time, when I am primed and in the mood to do it.\nIt is absolutely NOT when other people want me to speak or even listen to them. If they have anything to say (worth litening) they could write it down and send it to me.\nTools The old-school means of communication (uucp, then SMTP-based email, mailing lists with accessible archives, and the Usenet) were good-enough for everything.\nThe complex workflows were email-based (using attachments and external “processors of particular MIME content-types). The early stages of development of the Linux Kernel were (and partially still) email-based (with “hooks” to the version control system).\nIt is worth noting that recreating an old-school email-based workflows and even running local Usenet (NNTP) servers would boost non-bullshit productivity of any team (by forcing people to write their thoughts down - to think more that talk).\nEmacs It was not an arbitrary coincidence that everything, including very convenient, searchable access to Email and Usenet has been well-integrated into Emacs, which was at the time (and definitely still is) a working “environment” of smart people.\nThe “proper”, text-based and well-structured Web (as a self-publishing tool) has a decent support within Enacs too.\nThe only real major innovations (no jokes here) were web-based bug-tracking systems (Bugzilla) and the Wiki (https://wiki.c2.com/?WelcomeVisitors), which was a quick way to in-place edit a well-structured web content.\nTrac This pragmatic approach culminated with the Trac - web-based project management tool, which was a huge success at its time and still being used by serious projects (notably GHC).\nGthub Today all the old-school tech has been integrated into Github, which is in some sense an “enterprise version” of Trac.\n“The hell is other people” What people call “remote” or “WFH” works well only when it is based on some form of asynchronous, written communication.\nIn the past large and complex projects, from kernels, compilers (GHC) to whole operating systems (FreeBSD) has been successfully developed “remotely”. This proves (by example) that constant close interactions with “other people” are unnecessary and redundant.\nYes, whole “layers” of “managers” in some organizations exist only due to a mandatory in-person communications (endless meetings, standups, etc), but this is not necessarily a good thing and definitely is not required.\nThe related notion of misusing and abusing email and turning it into a constant meaningless flow of distractions (popularized by Cal Newport) is another serious argument about the actual harm of unnecessary communication.\nThe Brooks’s law is true exactly because of “neatly exponential” increase in inefficient and mostly redundant communication between people involved in a complex project. Eventually maintaining “required” social interactions would become the main time-consuming activity and the project will inevitably fail.\nAnonymity This is very deep notion, which emerged at the early days of the Internet and Usenet.\nIt is about reducing unnecessary emotionally-charged and redundant traction with the society. I simply do not need and do not want to know all the social aspects of your personality, not even your real name.\nThis goes back to the emergent internet (and Usenet) based “hacker” subculture, where nicknames (call signs) were good enough. The early internet “hacker” communities were bound by a common interest or a “common cause”, and the knowledge (in itself) were much more valuable than any personality.\nIt was indeed something similar to the way too abstract Greek ideal of an “elevated state” of only “exchanging of ideas”, but it emerges in the most pragmatic environment.\nThere is even deeper notion of anonymity, of not even having a distinct identity (a nickname or any other form of id “number”) and nevertheless contribute to “the common cause” by producing structured texts (documents or a source code). This is a remote ideal, of course.\nWhen one is spared from the unnecessary traction and burden of everything social (and socially constructed bullshit) one has literally more “energy” for thinking and doing what one chooses to do.\nThe main reason is that everything social is grossly emotional (“by design”) and unwanted emotions is the main cause of mental and even physical suffering. Most people are in the state of a constant painful struggle with themselves to control their own unwanted emotions, and this has the most profound consequences.\nThis is why modern anonymous imageboards (notably 4chan) which, by the way, still retain the old-school “spirit” of a minimalist mostly text based internet (well, images are there, but they are more like illustrations to the text, as it should be), more often than not has an incomparably better quality of the content that “social networks” where the social aspect is much more prominent.\nOf course, these image boards are full to the brim of the most profound stupid bullshit, which lie in between of the rare gems of anonymous knowledge and reason.\nRemote collaboration There are better ways to work, which cause less burnout, less dissatisfaction and disillusionment. It keeps one’s motivation and drive “high”, while dramatically cutting the emotional “costs” (which are very high).\nThis is what underlies all the early “hacker sub-culture” internet phenomena and what still “drives” the best anonymous image boards out there.\nWe asynchronously sent and receive [structured] text files Just as mathematicians of the past exchanged their written correspondence using a postal service and publications in printed “scientific journals”.\nAside from some technological innovations which saves the trees, this is still the most optimal way of dealing with knowledge.\nA knowledge-base in a Wiki is the only real innovation, and every non-bullshit project must have one.\nEmacs + structured text + git (version control) The good heuristic of a good workflow is that it required nothing but Emacs, a structured text of various formats (and related tools) and a version control system.\na Github repo In some sense Github done lots of things right, so another “less esoteric” heuristic would be “if it all fits into a private Github repo”, then it is probably “doing well”.\nOne more time, the functionality and the tooling Github provides is more than enough for everything “constructive”, just as a structured plain text is still good-enough for the internet itself to still be useful.\nRemote “Jobs” There are a few “maxims” which makes everything much simpler and less painful (for everyone involved).\nYou pay for may “structured texts” I write everything down in various strucured text formats – LaTeX (so you could read the underlying mathematics) and the source code in a half-a-dozen different languages (each of which has some aspects for the problem at hand).\nI start writing after I receive the first payment, I stop writing when you have a payment missed, and I abandon the project completely (and forget about you) when you miss 3 payments in a row. The very nice and robust core protocol.\nIt is that simple. No tention, no traction, no emotionally charged bullshit.\nOnlyfans of “structured texts” Another emergent social phenomena. People pay for some “content” because they find it “useful” for them for their own reasons.\nPeople who produce the “content”, more often than not, do not even want to know who the “consumers” are or anything personal about them. This eliminates lots of unnecessary burden.\nYes, there are sometimes “platinum sponsors” and what not, but we have start small.\nA subscription plan I work only remotely and alone. The only things you could get from me is some sort of structured text files, in exchange for a pre-paid subscription.\nthe Pre-paid GSM analogy Just as GSM operators optimize for minimization of loses (after spending heavily on its network infrastructure) and for minimization of in-person customer services, so I am optimizing for minimization of my own potential loses of time and money after spending heavily on education and development of an expertise.\nYou (an organization or an individual CEO or whoever) presumably have a problem to be solved and a big budget for it. If you don’t have a substantial money allocated for this problem of yours, there is nothing to talk about.\nSo, just like with pre-paid GSM plans, there is no service unless you pre-paid for it. Just as a GSM network does not care what you use it for, I don’t care what will you do with my code, math or writings. I just provide (partial) solutions for sub-problems as long as payments are.\nIf you are not satisfied you stop paying and switch to another, presumably better service. If I receive no payments I stop working. It is that simple.\nThere is no way you can influence me other than paying or not. I don’t even want to meet you (leave alone to participate in your meetings) just like GSM network technicians never meet any single customer in person.\nIndividual, detailed protocol could be established for a particular business arrangement (which correspond to simplest possible informal contracts), but the main principle remain the same - of a pre-paid GSM network substitution. No timely advance payment for the next time period – no service and no tension watsoever.\n",

<p>The old-school means of communication (<code>uucp</code>, then SMTP-based email, mailing
lists with accessible archives, and the <em>Usenet</em>) were good-enough for everything.</p>
<p>The complex workflows were <em>email-based</em> (using attachments and external &ldquo;processors of
particular <em>MIME content-types</em>). The early stages of development of the <em>Linux
Kernel</em> were (and partially still) email-based (with &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; to the version control
system).</p>
<p>It is worth noting that recreating an old-school email-based workflows and even
running local Usenet (NNTP) servers would boost non-bullshit productivity of any
team (by forcing people to write their thoughts down - to  think more that talk).</p>
<h3 id="emacs">Emacs<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#emacs">#</a></h3>
<p>It was not an arbitrary coincidence that everything, including very convenient,
searchable access to Email and Usenet has been well-integrated into <code>Emacs</code>, which
was at the time (and definitely still is) a working &ldquo;environment&rdquo; of smart people.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;proper&rdquo;, <em>text-based and well-structured</em> Web (as a self-publishing tool) has
a decent support within <code>Enacs</code> too.</p>
<p>The only real major innovations (no jokes here) were web-based <em>bug-tracking
systems</em> (Bugzilla) and the Wiki (<a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?WelcomeVisitors">https://wiki.c2.com/?WelcomeVisitors</a>), which
was a quick way to <em>in-place</em> edit a <em>well-structured</em> web content.</p>
<h3 id="trac">Trac<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#trac">#</a></h3>
<p>This pragmatic approach culminated with the <a href="https://trac.edgewall.com/">Trac -
web-based project management tool</a>, which was a huge success at its time and
still being used by serious projects (notably GHC).</p>
<h3 id="gthub">Gthub<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#gthub">#</a></h3>
<p>Today all the old-school tech has been integrated into <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>, which is in some
sense an &ldquo;enterprise version&rdquo; of <code>Trac</code>.</p>
<h2 id="the-hell-is-other-people">&ldquo;The hell is other people&rdquo;<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-hell-is-other-people">#</a></h2>
<p>What people call &ldquo;remote&rdquo; or &ldquo;WFH&rdquo; works well only when it is based on some
form of <em>asynchronous, written communication</em>.</p>
<p>In the past large and complex projects, from kernels, compilers (<a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a>) to whole operating
systems (<a href="https://freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a>) has been successfully developed &ldquo;remotely&rdquo;. This proves (by
example) that constant close interactions with &ldquo;other people&rdquo; are unnecessary
and redundant.</p>
<p>Yes, whole &ldquo;layers&rdquo; of &ldquo;managers&rdquo; in some organizations exist only due to a
mandatory in-person communications (endless meetings, standups, etc), but this
is not necessarily a good thing and definitely is not required.</p>
<p>The related notion of <em>misusing and abusing email</em> and turning it into a constant
meaningless flow of distractions (popularized by <em>Cal Newport</em>) is another serious
argument about the actual harm of unnecessary communication.</p>
<p>The <em>Brooks&rsquo;s law</em> is true exactly because of &ldquo;neatly exponential&rdquo; increase in
inefficient and mostly redundant communication between people involved in a
complex project. Eventually <em>maintaining &ldquo;required&rdquo; social interactions</em> would become the
main time-consuming activity and the project will <em>inevitably</em> fail.</p>
<h2 id="anonymity">Anonymity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#anonymity">#</a></h2>
<p>This is very deep notion, which emerged at the early days of the Internet and
Usenet.</p>
<p>It is about reducing unnecessary emotionally-charged and redundant <em>traction</em> with
the society. I simply <em>do not need and do not want to</em> know all the social aspects
of your personality, not even your real name.</p>
<p>This goes back to the emergent internet (and Usenet) based &ldquo;hacker&rdquo; subculture,
where nicknames (call signs) were good enough. The early internet &ldquo;hacker&rdquo; communities
were bound by a common <em>interest</em> or a &ldquo;common cause&rdquo;, and the knowledge (in
itself) were much more valuable than any personality.</p>
<p>It was indeed something similar to the way too abstract Greek ideal of an
&ldquo;elevated state&rdquo; of only &ldquo;exchanging of ideas&rdquo;, but it emerges in the most
<em>pragmatic</em> environment.</p>
<p>There is even deeper notion of anonymity, of not even having a distinct identity
(a nickname or any other form of id &ldquo;number&rdquo;) and nevertheless contribute to
&ldquo;the common cause&rdquo; by producing <em>structured texts</em> (documents or a source code).
This is a remote ideal, of course.</p>
<p>When one is spared from the unnecessary traction and burden of everything social (and
socially constructed bullshit) one has literally more &ldquo;energy&rdquo; for thinking and
doing what one chooses to do.</p>
<p>The main reason is that everything social is grossly emotional (&ldquo;by design&rdquo;) and
<strong>unwanted emotions</strong> is the main cause of mental and even physical suffering. Most
people are in the state of a constant painful struggle with themselves to
control their own unwanted emotions, and this has the most profound consequences.</p>
<p>This is why modern <em>anonymous imageboards</em> (notably <a href="https://4chan.org">4chan</a>) which, by the way,
still retain the old-school &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; of a minimalist <em>mostly text based
internet</em> (well, images are there, but they are more like <em>illustrations</em> to the
text, as it should be), more often than not has an incomparably better quality
of the content that &ldquo;social networks&rdquo; where the <em>social aspect</em> is much more prominent.</p>
<p>Of course, these image boards are full to the brim of the most profound stupid
bullshit, which lie in between of the rare gems of anonymous knowledge and reason.</p>
<h2 id="remote-collaboration">Remote collaboration<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#remote-collaboration">#</a></h2>
<p>There are better ways to work, which cause less burnout, less dissatisfaction
and disillusionment. It keeps one&rsquo;s motivation and drive &ldquo;high&rdquo;, while
dramatically cutting the emotional &ldquo;costs&rdquo; (which are very high).</p>
<p>This is what underlies all the early &ldquo;hacker sub-culture&rdquo; internet phenomena and
what still &ldquo;drives&rdquo; the best <em>anonymous image boards</em> out there.</p>
<h3 id="we-asynchronously-sent-and-receive-structured-text-files">We asynchronously sent and receive [structured] text files<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#we-asynchronously-sent-and-receive-structured-text-files">#</a></h3>
<p>Just as mathematicians of the past exchanged their written correspondence using
a postal service and publications in printed &ldquo;scientific journals&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Aside from some technological innovations which saves the trees, this is still
the most optimal way of dealing with <em>knowledge</em>.</p>
<p>A <em>knowledge-base</em> in a Wiki is the only real innovation, and every non-bullshit
project must have one.</p>
<h3 id="emacs-plus-structured-text-plus-git--version-control">Emacs  + structured text + git (version control)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#emacs-plus-structured-text-plus-git--version-control">#</a></h3>
<p>The good heuristic of a good workflow is that it required nothing but Emacs,
a structured text of various formats (and related tools) and a version control
system.</p>
<h3 id="a-github-repo">a Github repo<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-github-repo">#</a></h3>
<p>In some sense Github done lots of things right, so another &ldquo;less esoteric&rdquo;
heuristic would be <em>&ldquo;if it all fits into a private Github repo&rdquo;</em>, then it is
probably &ldquo;doing well&rdquo;.</p>
<p>One more time, the functionality and the tooling Github provides is more than
enough for everything &ldquo;constructive&rdquo;, just as a <em>structured plain text</em> is still
good-enough for the internet itself to still be useful.</p>
<h2 id="remote-jobs">Remote &ldquo;Jobs&rdquo;<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#remote-jobs">#</a></h2>
<p>There are a few &ldquo;maxims&rdquo; which makes everything much simpler and less painful
(for everyone involved).</p>
<h3 id="you-pay-for-may-structured-texts">You pay for may &ldquo;structured texts&rdquo;<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#you-pay-for-may-structured-texts">#</a></h3>
<p>I write everything down in various strucured text formats &ndash;  LaTeX (so you
could read the underlying <em>mathematics</em>) and the <em>source code</em> in a half-a-dozen
different languages (each of which has some aspects for the problem at hand).</p>
<p>I start writing after I receive the first payment, I stop writing when you have a
payment missed, and I abandon the project completely (and forget about you) when
you miss 3 payments in a row. The very nice and robust core <em>protocol</em>.</p>
<p>It is that simple. No tention, no traction, no emotionally charged bullshit.</p>
<h3 id="onlyfans-of-structured-texts">Onlyfans of &ldquo;structured texts&rdquo;<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#onlyfans-of-structured-texts">#</a></h3>
<p>Another emergent social phenomena. People pay for some &ldquo;content&rdquo; because they
find it &ldquo;useful&rdquo; for them for their own reasons.</p>
<p>People who produce the &ldquo;content&rdquo;, more often than not, do not even want to know
who the &ldquo;consumers&rdquo; are or anything personal about them. This eliminates lots of
unnecessary burden.</p>
<p>Yes, there are sometimes &ldquo;platinum sponsors&rdquo; and what not, but we have start
small.</p>
<h2 id="a-subscription-plan">A subscription plan<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-subscription-plan">#</a></h2>
<p>I work <em>only</em> remotely and alone. The only things you could get from me is
some sort of structured <em>text files</em>, in exchange for a <em>pre-paid subscription</em>.</p>
<h3 id="the-pre-paid-gsm-analogy">the Pre-paid GSM analogy<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-pre-paid-gsm-analogy">#</a></h3>
<p>Just as GSM operators optimize for minimization of loses (after spending
heavily on its network infrastructure) and <em>for minimization of in-person
customer services</em>, so I am optimizing for minimization of my own potential loses
of time and money after spending heavily on education and development of an expertise.</p>
<p>You (an organization or an individual CEO or whoever) presumably have a problem to
be solved and a big budget for it. If you don&rsquo;t have a substantial money allocated for
this problem of yours, there is nothing to talk about.</p>
<p>So, just like with pre-paid GSM plans, there is no service unless you
<em>pre-paid</em> for it. Just as a GSM network does not care what you use it
for, I don&rsquo;t care what will you do with my code, math or writings. I
just provide (partial) solutions for sub-problems as long as payments
are.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied you stop paying and switch to another, presumably
better service. If I receive no payments I stop working. It is that simple.</p>
<p>There is no way you can influence me other than paying or not. I don&rsquo;t
even want to meet you (leave alone to participate in your meetings) just
like GSM network technicians never meet any single customer in person.</p>
<p>Individual, detailed protocol could be established for a particular business
arrangement (which correspond to simplest possible informal contracts), but the
main principle remain the same - of a pre-paid GSM network substitution. No
<em>timely</em> advance payment for the next time period &ndash; no service and no tension watsoever.</p>
