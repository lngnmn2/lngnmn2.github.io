<p>So, what if you are late to the party?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, nowadays it is even much harder to get through all the utter bullshit and hype, but there is a sort of a shortcut or &ldquo;the Hard Way&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There are two and a half key figures: <em>Geoffrey Hinton</em>, who did most of the mathematical heavy lifting, <em>Andrew Ng</em>, who not just did all the derivations, but became the most famous practitioner, and <em>Andrej Karpathy</em> who us just a narcissistic asshole, similar to Lex Friedman.</p>
<p>Anyway, there essential video courses and readings.</p>

<p>All this is <em>non-bullshit</em> top quality learning material, including the Youtube videos.</p>
