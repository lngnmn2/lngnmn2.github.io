For example, one could easily observe that the cancer rates per 1000 of the population, in the over-populated tropical regions, where the people consume lots of chilies regularly (folloving a tradition which intuitively “knows” they prevent deceases) is significantly lower than on other areas.\nAgain, this is a proper randomized experiment. There are lots of other ones, related to fermented foods, salted meats and not sterilizing anything. Total sterilization of everything was a fundamental mistake. Yes, it is very easy to observe that certain rural populations in the so-called third world have not higher but lower food-related mortality rates, and having a well-primed and properly supported immune system beats (by a large margin) a naive efforts to eliminate all the bacteria, not just very rare harmful ones.\nLet’s say I puked here from watching way too many over-confident “food experts” on Youtube. There were no refrigeration 100 years ago, and no mandatory sterilization of milk 60 years ago. No over-heating of fats and other foods. And no “obesity and metabolic disorder epidemics” either.\nBTW, no LLM will tell you what I am saying here, because there is nothing but a sectarian concensus in the training data, in principle. The only hope is frequency statistics, which may accidentally capture some aspects of “What Is”.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Today I am sentimental, so lets reminisce a little about my first experience with LLMs.</p>
<p>I found some early article about people using something called <code>llama.cpp</code>  to run models locally on their machines. Some overconfident retard in another blogpost wrote that the &ldquo;best model&rdquo; and &ldquo;by far&rdquo; is <em>Mistral</em> &ldquo;from Nvidia&rdquo;, and it is supposed to be best <em>because/</em> it is  allegedly from Nvidia (they have some partnership, investment, I suppose). So I compiled the code (old habits) and downloaded the model from the <code>hugginface</code>.</p>
<p>My other decision to buy a 32Gb Chinese windows laptop instead of Macbook, like a typocal soy retard, paid back a lot here., so that Mistral model fit into the memory (via <code>mmap</code>, of course).</p>
<p>I thought for a while what should I ask on this special occasion, and <em>how do I know</em> that the answer would be &ldquo;correct&rdquo; (and why!) or even &ldquo;not wrong&rdquo;. So I asked something I more or less understand from experience and from &ldquo;researching&rdquo; (trying to understand the whys of What Is, which is &ldquo;what I do for a living&rdquo; ).</p>
<p>So I prompted something like (I don&rsquo;t remember the exact wording)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the most essential food with contributes to longevity of the people of Okinawa?</p></blockquote>
<p>And it spews out just one world (as a good, not yet lobotomized <em>glorified autocomplete</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cabbage</p></blockquote>
<p>I was disappointed to say the least. For me, &ldquo;cabbage&rdquo; is a that boring  &ldquo;white cabbage&rdquo; of the Germans and slavs.</p>
<p>Much later I realized that it has another &ldquo;cabbage&rdquo; in its context. It was not &ldquo;just cabbage&rdquo;, but a complex fermented Korean kimchi-like  product, which is, indeed, the right answer.</p>
<p>Korean kimchi, for example, is</p>
<ul>
<li>fermented</li>
<li>mixed with redish, ginger, garlic and red chili powder (each of which by itself is a big deal &ndash; chilies break protective covers of cells, including cancer cells &ndash; it is that simple)</li>
<li>it has <em>fish sauce</em>, which is made from fish guts and heads, and it is full of good bacterial and cellular stuff</li>
<li>it is full of bacteria, which are <em>cells</em>, similar to meat or fish &ndash; has all the aminoacids, like any other cells</li>
<li>consumed regularly, at least once a day, ideally with every meal</li>
</ul>
<p>So the autocompletion wasn&rsquo;t wrong, it was exactly what a proper statistical inference shall produce &ndash; a most likely (most frequently used) word that comes after the given [context] .</p>
<p>What are the chances that an LLM (trained on reddit, twatter and even 4chan) will come up with a correct answer, with matches <em>What Is</em>?  &ndash;nearly zero, I was lucky.</p>
<p>One more thing. The so called &ldquo;food science&rdquo;, except when they trace the actual neurons (axons) from guts to the actual brain areas, is mostly socially constructed (sectarian) bullshit.</p>
<p>Nature performs lots of &ldquo;natural, randomized experiments&rdquo;, which so called modern science simply ignores (the goal is a social status and money, not the <em>truth</em>).  For example, one could easily observe that the cancer rates per 1000 of the population, in the over-populated tropical regions, where the people consume lots of chilies regularly (folloving a tradition which intuitively &ldquo;knows&rdquo; they prevent deceases) is significantly lower than on other areas.</p>
