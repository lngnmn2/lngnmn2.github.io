<p>Yes, the code won&rsquo;t compile, and will be full of subtle hallucinations, The markdown files would be more of &ldquo;wishful thinking&rdquo; and &ldquo;confirmation bias&rdquo;  than a formal, rigorous description of the code, but still.</p>
<p>As long as you know what your are doing, is familiar with the underlying principles and concepts, without focusing too much on the irrelevant (yet) implementation details, one could &ldquo;guide&rdquo; it to build, lets say, a functional REPL based on the last 60 years of research in Functional Language&rsquo;s interpreters and the formally and rigorously defined underlying abstractions, which are being used in ML, Ocaml, Haskell and Scheme.</p>
