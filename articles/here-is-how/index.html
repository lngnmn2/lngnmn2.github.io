All this, in turn, is kind of obvious to those who have studied mathematics and logic, but the main point is that one can reason about the code in terms of these structural blocks, and this approach has fundamental cognitive advantages.\nBut it turns out that this very structural regularity of the modern code is exactly what allows LLMs to spew out seemingly coherent slop, that sometimes even compiles and runs. The building blocks usually have distinct shape – clear structural boundaries (with curly braces or other distinct begin and end marks). This allows the probabilistic slop generator to almost always come up with the correct whole blocks, without “knowing” any semantics whatsoever (again, all the information processing happens at the level of abstract, meaningless tokens).\nAnother big ideas that work are disciplined TDD and CI, which can be reduced to a small, incremental steps with a fast and tight feed-back loops on partial (incomplete) results, which, in turn, if you think for a second, underlay all animal’s [foraging] behaviour.\nThis is how the cognitive illusion (the Maya) works.\nNow consider the less structured code – the arbitrary config files, which have an irregular structure. All LLMs fail miserably. But why?\nThe answer is that the hidden relations among the individual elements of a config file are not encoded in the structure of the text, so an underlying NN does not capture the relation at all. It is that simple.\nAsk your favourite LLM to configure bluez with pulseaudio (both are fucking abomination and disgrace to a human intelligence) to use a high-quality “codec” for your bluetooth speakers. They will omit some necessary lines and hallucinate others. Why? Because how do they “know” that such and such option requires another one(s) to be enabled (or disabled) before that? These semantic dependencies are completely hidden and not represented at the level of syntax.\nIn the training set (some online forums, like Stack Overflow) people tend to give an incomplete answers, just some like that was missing or wrong, and thus LLMs missed out on the relations between other configuration options, which are arbitrary.\nSo, no “intelligence” whatsoever.\nThis can be even stated as a principle – all LLMs will fail on not sufficiently structured texts (when the semantic relations are not represented at the level of syntax).\nI do not even want to think about the abstract humanities slop – it has to always be incomplete and delusional, just as it is in the real life, but now you know exactly why and how.\nHere I am [metaphorically] peeing on @slutsker and @karpathy, and those who paid them hundreds of thousands.\n",
