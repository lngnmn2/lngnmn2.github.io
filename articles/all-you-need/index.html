<p>Data abstractions (ADTs) and specifications as the essence of a high-level programming, when on just adds new data-abstractions to a language.</p>
<p>This means that a &ldquo;core&rdquo; language should be augmented with Abstract Data Types in exactly the same way mathematics has been augmented with Sets or Monoids.</p>
<p>Notice that the &ldquo;procedural abstraction&rdquo; (lambdas) and &ldquo;data abstraction&rdquo; (ADTs) are everywhere <em>at all levels</em> (universal).</p>
<p>The &ldquo;iteration abstraction&rdquo; are an instance of a <em>standardized protocol</em> (interfaces and informal rules) defined as a type-class.</p>
<h3 id="the-miranda-language">The Miranda language<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-miranda-language">#</a></h3>
<p>The big idea here is that the &ldquo;core language&rdquo; should be an abstract machine (which interprets an augmented Lambda Calculus).</p>
