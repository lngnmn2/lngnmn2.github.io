There is no notion of any potential or possible outcomes. We just observe and count (measure).\nMy favorite example is from archery, when one just measures the distances between hits (arrows), sum them and divide by the number of shots fired (which is averaging of the distances). The player with the smallest average distance is objectively the most skilled one, with the most consistent actual outcomes.\nWe do not talk about any potentiality or possibility or potential outcomes, in principle. We just observe, count (measure), compare, sort out and take the min.\nProbability A set of all distinct possible (actually attainable or reachable) outcomes, “weighted” by coefficients which all sums to 1. The crucial part here is that all the outcomes are in a set.\nThis implies that missing a single crucial factor (a possible outcome) or adding one (or more) imaginary ones (which would never happen but have some weights) will render the whole “model” into a sophisticated mathematical bullshit.\nMissing a crucial factor is more “deadly” than having imaginary ones, since the “real” or actual ones will have approximately “correct” weights.\nCounting observations Just as in the classic settings (coin tosses and dices) we ultimately observe, bucket-sort and count observations, thus these are frequency based – the only valid probabilities.\nIn-principle incompatible with changes The proper notion of a probability (and the less-bullshit notion of “deep learning” based on back-propagation) is by definition applicable only to stable environments, which do not change structurally while you observe them, just as the given coins or dices remain stable.\nThis principle implies that most of application of probabilities to the markets is, in principle, bullshit. Do not do it.\nDeep learning This is a generalization of “fitting” a whole multi-dimensional [vector] space.\nThe main principle is the generalized methodology of back-propagation by updating the weights by calculating the partial derivatives is an ultimate fitting algorithm, which has been generalized to any number of “dimensions”.\nAgain, the “inputs” or observations must come from a stable (consistent) environment, otherwise some nonsense will be “leaned”, in principle.\nMarkov processes This is an example of superimposing an over-simplified views (model). It is OK to imagine that everything relevant has been properly captured in the estimated probabilities (which cannot be true, in principle - this is only a wishful thinking).\nOne more time - probabilities are applicable only to a stable, discrete, fully-observable systems, like coins, cards or dice.\nKalman filters Averaging of noisy measurements to estimate the actual value. This is what all the moving averages are – an attempt to estimate some “true” value of the price (or volume).\nThis is the less-bullshit part, because we measure and deal with imperfect, potentially faulty “instruments” which produce noisy readings.\nThis is, however, a super-imposed oversimplified view of reality, which is ultimately different from what the actual measurements signify.\nFrom the first principles Ultimately, we reverse (take the inverses of) all the operations which constructed (produced) the pattern.\nCandles have been constructed by putting together (addition) and scaling (multiplication).\nAll these are differentiable operations (partial derivatives can be taken).\nThis, as a ratio, shows how much the factor (a weight) contributes (the slope).\nTime Superimposing an abstract time scale, and then discarding the whole notion of time.\nDiscrete time - regular “notches” on an abstract “scale” (regular intervals). Time-invariant - the intervals are always the same (and never change).\nRise over Run - since Run is always a unit only Rise fully captures the notion.\nOrder A sequence (series) denotes only an order of events (evenly spaced “in time”).\nArithmetic Putting together and taking apart These are the ultimate universal notions, from which the abstract notion the Natural Numbers and the operations of addition and subtraction, multiplication and division (including a reminder) has been properly generalized (abstracted out).\n“Putting together” is so universal, that it is even prior to the notion of a Set, which is how the mind of an external observer categorizes observed “things”.\nEverything has to be traced back to these universals without losing or the meaning of the abstract concept. This is the key to have proper, valid abstractions.\nDifference A difference - what remains when this quantity has been taken away (subtracted from).\nDistance A distance - what is the difference (in notches on a Number Line) between two values (points)\nDivision Division - an inverse of multiplication, which is a repeated addition (not scaling) in this context.\nDivision - how many “times” this quantity has been added to itself, and what is the remainder is.\nRatio A ratio is an inverse notion of scaling (by a constant factor).\nRice-over-run is a ratio.\nTrend lines Averages Moving averages Derivatives A slope has a subtly different definition.\nKalman FIlters Markov processes ",

<h2 id="from-the-first-principles">From the first principles<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#from-the-first-principles">#</a></h2>
<p>Ultimately, we reverse (take the inverses of) all the operations which constructed (produced) the pattern.</p>
<p>Candles have been constructed by <em>putting together</em> (addition) and <em>scaling</em> (multiplication).</p>
<p>All these are <em>differentiable</em> operations (<em>partial derivatives</em> can be taken).</p>
<p>This, as a ratio, shows how much the factor (a weight) contributes (the slope).</p>
<h2 id="time">Time<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#time">#</a></h2>
<p>Superimposing an abstract time scale, and then discarding the whole notion of time.</p>
<p><em>Discrete time</em> - regular &ldquo;notches&rdquo; on an abstract &ldquo;scale&rdquo; (regular intervals).
<em>Time-invariant</em> - the intervals are always the same (and never change).</p>
<p><em>Rise over Run</em> - since <em>Run</em> is always a unit only Rise fully captures the notion.</p>
<h2 id="order">Order<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#order">#</a></h2>
<p>A <em>sequence</em> (series) denotes only an order of events (evenly spaced &ldquo;in time&rdquo;).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Putting together&rdquo; is so universal, that it is even prior to the notion of a Set, which is how the mind of an external observer categorizes observed &ldquo;things&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="difference">Difference<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#difference">#</a></h3>
<p>A difference - what remains when this quantity has been taken away (subtracted from).</p>
<h3 id="distance">Distance<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#distance">#</a></h3>
<p>A distance - what is the difference (in notches on a Number Line) between two values (points)</p>
<h3 id="division">Division<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#division">#</a></h3>
<p>Division - an inverse of multiplication, which is a repeated addition (not scaling) in this context.</p>
