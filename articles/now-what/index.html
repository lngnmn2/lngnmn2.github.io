<p>Understanding cannot be &ldquo;outsourced&rdquo; or even safely &ldquo;delegated&rdquo;. One will always end up with a sort of &ldquo;tragedy of commons&rdquo;, when sterilization and modern technologies produced packaged foods which slowly but surely kill you. This is what happens when you &ldquo;delegate&rdquo; your own understanding.</p>
<p>Lets begin from some general biological principles, which underlay everything humans do, no mater what abstract theorists in humanties would babble about &ldquo;free will&rdquo; and what not.</p>
<p>Any autistic person faces just one &ldquo;burning&rdquo; fundamental problem &ndash; how to avoid that highly unpleasant and unwanted state of being overwhelmed, agitated and overloaded with inappropriately exaggerated &ldquo;responses&rdquo; which amygdala triggers.</p>
<p>The answer is almost universal &ndash; they &ldquo;escape&rdquo; into restricted, repetitive behaviors and activities, which quickly became very strong habits, which give them better hormonal responses &ndash; less cortisol, more serotonin and dopamine.</p>
<p>Yes, autism is a full spectrum of just this &ndash; learned coping mechanisms, and the underlying genetic factors.</p>
<p>This crudely outlined (but true) biological mechanism is behind what I call &ldquo;small tasks&rdquo;, and is the underlying basis of any regular, ritualized religious activities (and all the &ldquo;feelings&rdquo; they evoke), the basis of all repetitive drills, compulsive cleaning, <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>Accomplishing a  &ldquo;small tasks&rdquo; gives quick, immediate feedback in terms of hormonal spikes, and one becomes addicted it. It can be performing a ritual, preparing a meal, or cleaning the room for 10th time (<em>We Got A Winner!</em>).</p>
<p>This is exactly the basis of bad &ldquo;programming&rdquo; we call &ldquo;coding&rdquo; (without understanding). Most of crappy code has been written due to dopamine spikes of unqualified individuals, where the quick reward for that something &ldquo;works&rdquo; is substituted for the proper understanding and doing &ldquo;the right thing&rdquo; (which, by definition, is one of many), which is hard, slow and unrewarding, like first miserable years of irregular running. We call it &ldquo;low-effort crap&rdquo; (hello, &ldquo;<code>systemd</code>&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Just as lots of people love to talk (mostly bullshit), lots of coders love to write code (mostly low-effort crap). We have been drowned in this kind of code, especially in <em>webshit</em> and now in Python &ldquo;<em>AI</em>&rdquo; slop.</p>
