      <description>Have you ever thought why the Set Theory and Predicate Logic looks &amp;ldquo;the same&amp;rdquo; when being visualized using Venn and Euler diagrams?
Are these partitions is the most fundamental abstract building block?
Most of the examples which are used to explain logic has been drawn from &amp;ldquo;natural categories&amp;rdquo; of biological species - mammals, reptiles, men.
These are distinct partitions indeed, but how they came to be as they are?
It is because somewhere in the past a literal &amp;ldquo;fork&amp;rdquo;, a mutation (or a whole set of these) occurred (and the resulting population survived).</description>

      <title>Notes on proper abstractions and ADTs</title>

      <description>Special concern for precise definitions, clarity and brevity (omitting of what is clear from the context), high level of abstraction, and proper generality (just like Sets or Numbers).
Both algebraic types (&amp;ldquo;products&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sums&amp;rdquo;), could be used &amp;ldquo;like tables&amp;rdquo;, with new columns being added without affecting any code that is already out there.
This implies a by name instead of position-based (offset) access.
This, in turn, is the fundamental, definitive property of structs over tuples.</description>

      <description>Today https://news.ycombinator.com/ is glowing bright with AI memes and buzzwords like a Christmas tree. Everyone is there, including billion dollar corporations announcing a &amp;ldquo;CodeLama-34b&amp;rdquo; which is &amp;ldquo;designed for general code synthesis and understanding.&amp;rdquo;
First of all, I personaly do not want to rely in any part of my life on any &amp;ldquo;synthesized&amp;rdquo; (and &amp;ldquo;understood&amp;rdquo; software, and demand an explicit opt-out. Yes, yes, I know.
If I have any understanding of these subjects at all, this is a bubble and irrational exuberance.</description>

      <title>Writing a semi-automated trading system</title>
      <link>https://lngnmn2.github.io/articles/automated-trading/</link>

      <description>AUTHOR: &amp;lt;lngnmn2@yahoo.com&amp;gt;
Writing a semi-automated trading system is easy - just ask John Carmack to write it down for you.
Before that Eric Evans has to extract the domain knowledge using his DDD approach, and then some top mathematician, or maybe Bartosz Milewski, would build a consistent model from it.
Maybe it is even better to rather ask Simon Peyton Jones to write a matching engine, so you will have it pure-functional, with the most important parts formally proven in Coq (and then translated into Haskell code).</description>

      <description>Stupid people would usually ask &amp;ldquo;why do we need all this theoretical bullshit and abstracted theories&amp;rdquo;?
The answer is, to have &amp;ldquo;the right understanding&amp;rdquo; and because of that to be able to do things &amp;ldquo;just right&amp;rdquo;.
&amp;ldquo;Just right&amp;rdquo; has many meanings and implications. Among other things it is that what has been &amp;ldquo;done right&amp;rdquo; (ideally &amp;ndash; a local optimum) does not require any further modifications.
It was indeed &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; (right). There is nothing more to remove (or alter).</description>

      <title>The recurring patterns captured as a Monoid</title>

      <description>The common patterns There are recurrent patterns, which has been captured in familiar &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; abstractions.
Monoid A Set along with a composition operation, which has an identity element.
addition, for (+) identity is 0 concatenation, which is a specialization of putting together, identity is &amp;quot;&amp;quot;. List, a fundamental recursive sum-type, identity is [] Option, a specialization of empty/non-empty aspect of a List, identity is None Boolean logic, very subtle, identity is False (false imply nothing) The notion that some Boolean operations form a Monoid is very subtle, but it will emerge with conditional expressions.</description>

      <title>Understanding Rust</title>
      <link>https://lngnmn2.github.io/articles/unrestanding-rust/</link>

      <description>The Rust programming language has been hyped as a system programming language, which implies that it has to have an explicit &amp;ldquo;access&amp;rdquo; to the hardware-level abstractions, such as the Stack, the Heap and the Procedures, together with the operating system-level abstractions, such as following the particular calling conventions (a set of standardized interfaces) for an &amp;ldquo;arch and OS /duo&amp;rdquo;, and to be &amp;ldquo;aware of&amp;rdquo; the ABIs in general.
Overview Rust is, in principle, an imperative language.</description>

      <title>The simplest self-publishing workflow</title>
      <link>https://lngnmn2.github.io/articles/the-simplest-workflow/</link>

      <description>Overview This is the simplest but smart self-publishing workflow.
org-mode -&amp;gt; ox_hugo -&amp;gt; hugo -&amp;gt; static html -&amp;gt; git commit -a -&amp;gt; git push -&amp;gt; github pages
Everything is according to the universal principles of being almost &amp;ldquo;pure functional transformations&amp;rdquo; of a structured and decorated text, together with version control, which provides sort of immutability (of the previous versions).
At each stage or step we delegate some aspect to an appropriate external vendored tool.</description>
