      <title>The recurring patterns captured as a Monoid</title>

      <description>The common patterns There are recurrent patterns, which has been captured in familiar &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; abstractions.
Monoid A Set along with a composition operation, which has an identity element.
addition, for (+) identity is 0 concatenation, which is a specialization of putting together, identity is &amp;quot;&amp;quot;. List, a fundamental recursive sum-type, identity is [] Option, a specialization of empty/non-empty aspect of a List, identity is None Boolean logic, very subtle, identity is False (false imply nothing) The notion that some Boolean operations form a Monoid is very subtle, but it will emerge with conditional expressions.</description>

      <description>The Rust programming language has been hyped as a system programming language, which implies that it has to have an explicit &amp;ldquo;access&amp;rdquo; to the hardware-level abstractions, such as the Stack, the Heap and the Procedures, together with the operating system-level abstractions, such as following the particular calling conventions (a set of standardized interfaces) for an &amp;ldquo;arch and OS /duo&amp;rdquo;, and to be &amp;ldquo;aware of&amp;rdquo; the ABIs in general.
Overview Rust is, in principle, an imperative language.</description>

      <description>Overview This is the simplest but smart self-publishing workflow.
org-mode -&amp;gt; ox_hugo -&amp;gt; hugo -&amp;gt; static html -&amp;gt; git commit -a -&amp;gt; git push -&amp;gt; github pages
Everything is according to the universal principles of being almost &amp;ldquo;pure functional transformations&amp;rdquo; of a structured and decorated text, together with version control, which provides sort of immutability (of the previous versions).
At each stage or step we delegate some aspect to an appropriate external vendored tool.</description>
