      <description>There is a typical quote from some random Chud on the internet:
The location within the [high-dimensional hyper-] space represents the semantic meaning of the content, according to the embedding modelâ€™s weird, mostly incomprehensible understanding of the world.
This is bullshit at so many levels, and in a such &amp;ldquo;lecturing&amp;rdquo; tone.
First of all, there is no &amp;ldquo;understanding&amp;rdquo; whatsoever and it is not &amp;ldquo;of the world&amp;rdquo;.
&amp;ldquo;The world&amp;rdquo; is at a fundamentally different level of abstraction from what has been used as &amp;ldquo;inputs&amp;rdquo; to a language model.</description>

      <title>  Neurons &#34;reuse&#34;

      <description>There is an inportant subtlety when on is trying to interpret what a Neural Network actually does &amp;ndash; each neuron, it seems, gets activated on a different set of inputs which corresponds to very different set of features. It is most prominent in a computer vision settings, when a selected neuron reacts on completely unrelated parts of inputs, say of cats and of cars.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see what is going on out there.</description>

      <description>It is more or less obvious why AI and LLM bubble is so huge - imagine just charging money for every https request to a RESTful API, without, literally, being responsible about the quality of the responce (it is not out fault if a LLM returned bullshit to you, or, which is much worse &amp;ndash; a highly sophisiticated, convincing subtle bullshit).
Again, there is not enough good code to train a model on it.</description>

      <description>These are just assorted notes for now, which shall become something ready to be formalized.
Non-bullshit The objective is to train a NN which captures subtle recurrent patterns among many well-chosen (and well-defined) features.
The proper set of features that, in turn, captures the most relevant aspects of reality is what determines the distinction between a modest success or a total failure of this ML approach.
All the features should be actual &amp;ldquo;measurements&amp;rdquo; of something real, like &amp;ldquo;Open Interest&amp;rdquo; or the &amp;ldquo;Long/Short ratio&amp;rdquo; and other obvious measurements like &amp;ldquo;Volume&amp;rdquo;.</description>
