      <description>There is something to realize &amp;ndash; some zoomer (a teenager) brought down a unique world-wide service using some ready-made exploit, probably found on the web, against way outdated unpatched PHP crap.
The most important thing is that the whole website seem to be never updated after being bought from @moot. This explains anything one needs to know about the how.
It does not really matter which particular attack has been executed &amp;ndash; it is against old PHP which is a fractal of bad design by definition.</description>
