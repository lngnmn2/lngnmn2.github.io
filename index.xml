      <description>A few words about me I am Jack&amp;rsquo;s wasted life.
I wrote a bunch of articles by an organ in the first person.
https://schiptsov.github.io/
My HN footprint My relationships with https://news.ycombinator.com/ was rather stormy.
I would say that I have graduated from it, starting as a naive idealist on the best (at the very beginning) free English-media technologist site, and ended up as a bitter dissident from the heavily policed and strictly moderated Chud&amp;rsquo;s safe space.</description>

      <description>The Rust programming language has been hyped as a system programming language, which implies that it has to have an explicit &amp;ldquo;access&amp;rdquo; to the hardware-level abstractions, such as the Stack, the Heap and the Procedures, together with the operating system-level abstractions, such as following the particular calling conventions (a set of standardized interfaces) for an &amp;ldquo;arch and OS /duo&amp;rdquo;, and to be &amp;ldquo;aware of&amp;rdquo; the ABIs in general.
Overview Rust is, in principle, an imperative language.</description>

      <description>Overview This is the simplest but smart self-publishing workflow.
org-mode -&amp;gt; ox_hugo -&amp;gt; hugo -&amp;gt; static html -&amp;gt; git commit -a -&amp;gt; git push -&amp;gt; github pages
Everything is according to the universal principles of being almost &amp;ldquo;pure functional transformations&amp;rdquo; of a structured and decorated text, together with version control, which provides sort of immutability (of the previous versions).
At each stage or step we delegate some aspect to an appropriate external vendored tool.</description>
